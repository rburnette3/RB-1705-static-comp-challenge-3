## Static Comp-3 ##

This is the third and final Static Comp Challenge for Mod1.  The layout of this comp was extremely complex and full of moving parts which needed to be accounted for during the responsive design.  I first reproduced this comp from the desktop view as opposed to the mobile view.  I first accounted for the aside, knowing that it would shift being a slide out menu and then built the rest of the HTML structure by blocking of each section.  once this was completed i styled each item accordingly and added hover states to represent button and clickable items.  Blocking off the sections made responsiveness fairly cooperative as the items could easily shift and stack on each other.
